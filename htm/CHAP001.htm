This manual describes the GRAPE (Version&nbsp;4.8.1) package for computing
with graphs and groups.
<p>
GRAPE is primarily designed for the construction and analysis of
finite graphs related to groups, designs, and geometries. Special
emphasis is placed on the determination of regularity properties and
subgraph structure. The GRAPE philosophy is that a graph <var>gamma</var>
always comes together with a known subgroup <var>G</var> of the automorphism
group of <var>gamma</var>, and that <var>G</var> is used to reduce the storage and
CPU-time requirements for calculations with <var>gamma</var> (see
<a href="biblio.htm#Soi93"><cite>Soi93</cite></a> and <a href="biblio.htm#Soi04"><cite>Soi04</cite></a>).  Of course <var>G</var> may be the trivial group,
and in this case GRAPE algorithms may perform more slowly than strictly
combinatorial algorithms (although this degradation in performance is
hopefully never more than a fixed constant factor).
<p>
Most GRAPE functions are written entirely in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> language.
However, the GRAPE functions <code>AutomorphismGroup</code>, <code>AutGroupGraph</code>,
<code>IsIsomorphicGraph</code>, <code>GraphIsomorphismClassRepresentatives</code>,
<code>GraphIsomorphism</code>  and <code>PartialLinearSpaces</code> make direct or indirect
use the nauty <a href="biblio.htm#Nau90"><cite>Nau90</cite></a>, <a href="biblio.htm#MP14"><cite>MP14</cite></a> or bliss <a href="biblio.htm#JK07"><cite>JK07</cite></a> packages,
via a GRAPE interface.  These functions can only be used on a fully
installed version of GRAPE. Installation of GRAPE is described in
this chapter of the manual.
<p>
Except for the nauty package of B.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;McKay included with GRAPE,
the function <code>SmallestImageSet</code> by Steve Linton, the nauty interface
by Alexander Hulpke, and the initial bliss interface by Jerry James,
the GRAPE package was designed and written by Leonard H. Soicher,
School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London.

<h2><a name="SECT001">1.1 Installing the GRAPE Package</a></h2>
<p><p>
The official <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> Windows distribution includes the GRAPE package
fully installed.  Thus, GRAPE normally requires no further installation
for Windows users of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>. What follows is for Unix users of GRAPE.
<p>
You do not need to download and unpack an archive for GRAPE unless you
want to install the package separately from your main <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> installation
or are installing an upgrade of GRAPE to an existing installation
of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> (see the main <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> reference section <a href="../../../doc/ref/chap76.html#X82473E4B8756C6CD">REF:Installing a GAP Package</a>).  If you do need to download GRAPE, you can find the most
recent <code>.tar.gz</code> archive at <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/grape">https://gap-packages.github.io/grape</a>.
The archive file should be downloaded and unpacked in the <code>pkg</code>
subdirectory of an appropriate <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> root directory (see the main <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
reference section <a href="../../../doc/ref/chap9.html#X7A4973627A5DB27D">REF:GAP Root Directories</a>).
<p>
If your GRAPE installation does not include a pre-compiled binary of 
the nauty/dreadnaut programs included with GRAPE and you do not want 
to use an already installed version of nauty or bliss, you will 
need to perform compilation of the nauty/dreadnaut programs included with
GRAPE, and to do this in a Unix environment, you should proceed as
follows.  After installing <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>, go to the GRAPE home directory
(usually the directory <code>pkg/grape</code> of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> home directory),
and run <code>./configure </code><var>path</var><code></code>, where <var>path</var> is the path of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
home directory.  So for example, if you install GRAPE in the <code>pkg</code>
directory of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> home directory, run 
<pre>
./configure ../..
</pre>
This will fetch the name of the architecture for which <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
has been most recently configured, and create a <code>Makefile</code>. Now run
<pre>
make 
</pre>
to create the nauty/dreadnaut binary and to put
it in the appropriate place.  This configuration/make process for
GRAPE only works for the <strong>last</strong> architecture for which <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> was
configured. Therefore, you should always follow the above procedure to
install the nauty/dreadnaut binary immediately after compiling <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
for a given configuration, say for a different architecture on a common
file system. However, if you want to add GRAPE later, you can just run
<code>./configure</code> again in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> home directory for the architecture,
before performing the GRAPE configure/make process to install the
nauty/dreadnaut binary for that architecture.
<p>
To use GRAPE with a separately installed version of nauty or
bliss you should proceed as follows. Please note that the nauty
interface for GRAPE has only been extensively tested with the
included Version&nbsp;2.2 of nauty, and the bliss interface has only
been tested with Version&nbsp;0.73 of bliss. To use a separately
installed version of nauty, type the following commands in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>, or 
place these commands in your <code>gaprc</code> file (see <a href="../../../doc/ref/chap3.html#X84D4CF587D437C00">REF:The gaprc file</a>), where
<code>dreadnaut_or_dreadnautB_executable</code> should be the name of your
dreadnaut or dreadnautB executable file:
<pre>
LoadPackage("grape"); 
GRAPE_NAUTY := true; 
GRAPE_DREADNAUT_EXE := "dreadnaut_or_dreadnautB_executable"; 
</pre>
To use a separately installed version of bliss instead of nauty,
type the following commands in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>, or place these commands in your
<code>gaprc</code> file (see <a href="../../../doc/ref/chap3.html#X84D4CF587D437C00">REF:The gaprc file</a>), where <code>bliss_executable</code> should be
the name of your bliss executable file:
<pre>
LoadPackage("grape"); 
GRAPE_NAUTY := false; 
GRAPE_BLISS_EXE := "bliss_executable"; 
</pre>
For example, if the bliss executable is <code>/usr/local/bin/bliss</code>, then type:
<pre>
LoadPackage("grape"); 
GRAPE_NAUTY := false; 
GRAPE_BLISS_EXE := "/usr/local/bin/bliss"; 
</pre>
<p>
You should now test GRAPE and the interface to nauty or bliss
on each architecture on which you have installed GRAPE. Start up
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> and at the prompt type 
<pre>
LoadPackage( "grape" ); 
</pre>
On-line documentation for GRAPE should be available by typing 
<pre>
?GRAPE 
</pre>
Then run some tests by typing:
<pre>
Test(Filename(DirectoriesPackageLibrary("grape","tst"),"testall.tst"));
</pre>
This should return the value <code>true</code>.
<p>
A pdf version of the GRAPE manual is available as <code>manual.pdf</code> in the
<code>doc</code> directory of the home directory of GRAPE.
<p>
If you install GRAPE, then please tell <a href="mailto:L.H.Soicher@qmul.ac.uk">L.H.Soicher@qmul.ac.uk</a>,
where you should also send any comments or bug reports.
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="SECT002">1.2 Loading GRAPE</a></h2>
<p><p>
Before using GRAPE you must load the package within <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> via: 
<p>
<pre>
gap&gt; LoadPackage("grape");
true
</pre>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="SECT003">1.3 The structure of a graph in GRAPE</a></h2>
<p><p>
In general GRAPE deals with finite directed graphs which may have
loops but have no multiple edges. However, many GRAPE functions only
work for <strong>simple</strong> graphs (i.e. no loops, and whenever [<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>] is an
edge then so is [<i>y</i>,<i>x</i>]), but these functions will check if an input
graph is simple.
<p>
In GRAPE, a graph <var>gamma</var> is stored as a record, with mandatory
components <code>isGraph</code>, <code>order</code>, <code>group</code>, <code>schreierVector</code>,
<code>representatives</code>, and <code>adjacencies</code>. Usually, the user need not be
aware of this record structure, and is strongly advised only to use
GRAPE functions to construct and modify graphs.
<p>
The <code>order</code> component contains the number of vertices of <var>gamma</var>. The
vertices of <var>gamma</var> are always 1,2,...,<code></code><var>gamma</var><code>.order</code>, but they may also
be given <strong>names</strong>, either by a user (using <code>AssignVertexNames</code>) or by a
function constructing a graph (e.g. <code>InducedSubgraph</code>, <code>BipartiteDouble</code>,
<code>QuotientGraph</code>). The <code>names</code> component, if present, records these
names, with <code></code><var>gamma</var><code>.names[</code><var>i</var><code>]</code> the name of vertex <var>i</var>.  If the <code>names</code>
component is not present (the user may, for example, choose to unbind
it), then the names are taken to be 1,2,...,<code></code><var>gamma</var><code>.order</code>. The <code>group</code>
component records the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> permutation group associated with <var>gamma</var>
(this group must be a subgroup of the automorphism group of <var>gamma</var>). The
<code>representatives</code> component records a set of orbit representatives
for the action of <code></code><var>gamma</var><code>.group</code> on the vertices of <var>gamma</var>, with
<code></code><var>gamma</var><code>.adjacencies[</code><var>i</var><code>]</code> being the set of vertices adjacent to
<code></code><var>gamma</var><code>.representatives[</code><var>i</var><code>]</code>. The <code>group</code> and <code>schreierVector</code>
components are used to compute the adjacency-set of an arbitrary vertex
of <var>gamma</var> (this is done by the function <code>Adjacency</code>).
<p>
The only mandatory component which may change once a graph is initially
constructed is <code>adjacencies</code> (when an edge-orbit of <code></code><var>gamma</var><code>.group</code> is
added to, or removed from, <var>gamma</var>). A graph record may also have some
of the optional components <code>isSimple</code>, <code>autGroup</code>, and
<code>canonicalLabelling</code>, which record information about that graph.
<p>

<h2><a name="SECT004">1.4 Examples of the use of GRAPE</a></h2>
<p><p>
We give here a simple example to illustrate the use of GRAPE. All
functions used are described in detail in this manual. More
sophisticated examples of the use of GRAPE can be found in
chapter <a href="CHAP009.htm#SSEC001.1">Partial Linear Spaces</a>, and also in the references <a href="biblio.htm#Cam99"><cite>Cam99</cite></a>,
<a href="biblio.htm#CSS99"><cite>CSS99</cite></a>, <a href="biblio.htm#HL99"><cite>HL99</cite></a> and <a href="biblio.htm#Soi06"><cite>Soi06</cite></a>.
<p>
In the example here, we construct the Petersen graph <i>P</i>, and its edge
graph (also called line graph) <i>EP</i>. We compute the global parameters
of <i>EP</i>, and so verify that <i>EP</i> is distance-regular (see <a href="biblio.htm#BCN89"><cite>BCN89</cite></a>).
